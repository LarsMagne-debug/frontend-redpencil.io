        <p class="text-white text-sm text-gray-light w-3/4">As technology professionals, we like to see how the
          applications we use work. Even more, if we see really good solutions we want to implement them ourselves.
          There are many reasons why open-source conquered the world of software development, but behind it all is the
          idea that a large, open community of developers results in better software than any closed group.
          Open source development is in our DNA. It is a way of thinking.
